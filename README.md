### Computer Network Project 02
# WIRESHARK

In this project, we will understand what is **Wireshark** and its tools. First of all, **WiresharkÂ©** is a tool that allows monitoring of sending/receiving packets on network cards. There are two modes of operation: Capture and Open. 
1. *Capture* mode allows users to directly view the current packets entering / exiting the network card, and can save them in pcap file format.
2. *Open* mode allows users to read existing pcap file packets.
There will be four main examples in this project. For more details, please read *Wireshark-2021-12.pdf* file provided above.
