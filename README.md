WIRESHARK
In this project, we will understand what is "Wireshark" and its tools. First of all, Wireshark is a tool that allows monitoring of sending/receiving packets on network cards. There are two modes of operation: Open and Capture. 
1. Capture mode allows users to directly view the current packets entering / exiting the network card, and can save them in pcap file format. 
2. Open mode allows users to read existing pcap file packets.
